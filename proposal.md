# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
"Quotable"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
An IOS app that allows users to enter quotes their friends say.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
The software will be written in swift using XCODE, and will be designed specifically for iphone.
Users will be able to input a quote and the name of a friend who said it.
Once quotes are entered, there will be a game of "Quote "Roulette," 
where the software will present a quote and allow the user to guess which of their friends said it. 
Focus will be placedon a user friendly interface, and efficient storage of information entered. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Ethan Engle tut97077@temple.edu TA elmira
John kroll john.kroll0001@temple.edu TA elmira
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
At very least, the app will keep track of friends quotes and store this information locally. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A feature that would benefit the project would be the ability to sort by certain friends,
And/Or search keywords when you are trying to remember what quote you wrote down.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
Best outcome would be the inclusion of the quote roulette party game, where users could guess who said what.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My team and I will all be learning how to code in swift. We will likely begin by creating a very basic
input system that stores the quote along with the name separately. Then we will begin working on the UI and 
user experience. Introducing features such as editing and deleting quotes will be the next step, and Finally working on
the party-game aspect will be the final thing we introduce to the project. We have not yet discussed who will do what, but we 
will all collectively be learning swift together and working as a team to create the best project possible.
